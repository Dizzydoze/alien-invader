To be or not to be, that is the question
Be the change you wish to see
Turn your wounds into wisdom
If it matters to you, you’ll find a way
Do it with passion or not at all
Grow through what you go through
Take the risk or lose the chance
An aim in life is the only fortune worth finding
Life is not an exact science, it is an art
Do one thing every day that scares you
Good things happen to those who hustle
Every noble work is at first impossible
Each day provides its own gifts
Fall seven times, stand up eight
When nothing goes right, go left
She believed she could, so she did
Impossible is for the unwilling
You never fail until you stop trying
Whatever you do, do with all your might
Once you choose hope, anything’s possible
Be yourself; everyone else is already taken
