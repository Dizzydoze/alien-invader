It's true that happy wife leads to happy life
San Francisco is the best city to innovate!
Be faithful to that which exists within yourself
The wisest mind has something yet to learn
Don’t tell people your plans, show them your results
Persistence guarantees that results are inevitable
The true success is the person who invented himself
We can do anything we want to if we stick to it long enough
It is hard to fail, but it is worse never to have tried to succeed
Imagination is the highest form of research
Life is anything that dies when you stomp on it
With the new day comes new strength and new thoughts
Either you run the day or the day runs you
Live your life, do your work, then take your hat
Our truest life is when we are in dreams awake
Luck is great, but most of life is hard work
Only the hand that erases can write the true thing
Old age is just a record of one's whole life
The person lives twice who lives the first life well
Our life always expresses the result of our dominant thoughts
My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive
I have not failed. I’ve just found 10,000 ways that won’t work
